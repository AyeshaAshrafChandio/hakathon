## Prompt

Create core principles for the Physical AI course book. Focus on Embodied Intelligence, ROS2 reliability, high-fidelity simulation, and safety standards.

## Response snapshot

Here are the core principles for the Physical AI course book:

1.  **Embodied Intelligence**: Emphasize the development of AI systems that learn and interact with the physical world through their own bodies, focusing on real-world perception, action, and adaptation.
2.  **ROS2 Reliability and Robustness**: Prioritize the use of ROS2 for building dependable and scalable robotic applications, covering best practices for system design, error handling, and deployment in diverse environments.
3.  **High-Fidelity Simulation for Development and Testing**: Advocate for the extensive use of accurate and realistic simulations to accelerate development, enable rigorous testing, and ensure the safety and performance of physical AI systems before real-world deployment.
4.  **Adherence to Safety Standards and Ethical AI Principles**: Integrate comprehensive coverage of safety protocols, risk assessment, and ethical considerations in the design, implementation, and operation of physical AI, ensuring responsible and secure development.

# 02-ROS-2: Module 1 - Robot Operating System 2 Fundamentals

## Purpose

This document specifies the content and learning objectives for Module 1 of the Physical AI course book, focusing on the fundamentals of ROS 2 and its application in embodied intelligence.

## Key Concepts and Topics

Module 1 will cover the following essential ROS 2 concepts:

*   **ROS 2 Communication Mechanisms**: In-depth exploration of the core communication paradigms in ROS 2:
    *   **Nodes**: Understanding the basic building blocks of a ROS 2 system, their lifecycle, and execution management.
    *   **Topics**: Publishing and subscribing to data streams for real-time sensor data, control commands, and state information.
    *   **Services**: Implementing synchronous request-response communication for specific actions and queries.

*   **`rclpy` Python Client Library**: Practical integration of ROS 2 with Python, enabling developers to write nodes, publishers, subscribers, and services using the `rclpy` library. This includes:
    *   Setting up a ROS 2 workspace with Python packages.
    *   Creating and managing `rclpy` nodes.
    *   Implementing data exchange using topics and services in Python.

*   **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for Humanoids**: Defining and modeling robotic systems, with a specific focus on humanoids. This section will cover:
    *   Creating URDF files to describe robot kinematics, dynamics, and visual properties.
    *   Integrating URDF models into ROS 2 for simulation and visualization.
    *   Advanced URDF concepts for complex humanoid structures, including joint limits, transmissions, and sensor attachments.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of Module 1, students will be able to:

*   Understand and utilize ROS 2 communication mechanisms (Nodes, Topics, Services).
*   Develop ROS 2 applications using the `rclpy` Python client library.
*   Create and integrate URDF models for humanoid robots within a ROS 2 environment.
*   Set up and manage a ROS 2 workspace for Python-based robotics projects.

# 01-Introduction: Physical AI Course Book

## Purpose

This document outlines the core definition and scope of the "Physical AI" course book, intended as a comprehensive textbook for students and practitioners transitioning from purely digital AI concepts to embodied intelligence within physical systems.

## Key Focus Areas

The book will cover the fundamental principles and practical applications of Physical AI, with a strong emphasis on:

*   **Embodied Intelligence**: Understanding how AI systems learn, perceive, and act within the physical world through robotic platforms.
*   **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: Utilizing ROS 2 as the foundational framework for developing robust, scalable, and real-time robotic applications.
*   **High-Fidelity Simulation**: Employing simulation environments like Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac to enable safe, efficient, and cost-effective development, testing, and validation of Physical AI systems.

## Core Deliverables

The primary deliverables for this project include:

1.  **AI Book**: The complete "Physical AI" textbook, encompassing theoretical foundations, practical guides, and case studies.
2.  **RAG Chatbot**: An accompanying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot designed to assist readers with queries, provide additional context, and enhance the learning experience by leveraging the book's content.
